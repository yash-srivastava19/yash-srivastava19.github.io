### The Life in Review Interview

Life seems like a movie that feels like it is building up to something beautiful.  There's always something to look forward to - and the best part about life is that it always gives you a fresh start every 24 hours. From the eyes of the protagonist, having to live all of those 24 hours doing something "heroic" feels a bit overwhelming. Having something always to look forward to sometimes places less importance to what we have now.   

That's life. On surface it seems like there should always be something to look forward to, but mostly it's a game of chase - and that too the wrong one. Chase is good when what you are getting from it is a felling of achievement, not feeling of relief. This is the reason why so many people tend to feel lost when they have achieved their goals, because what they were chasing was a feeling. 

Imagine having to sit down for an interview at the end of your life having to describe yourself, maybe giving a life in review interview, and all you had was a mixed bag of unprocessed emotions and achievements, which at this point, even you can't feel connected to - and I don't think that is something someone should strive for. Your life in review should a collection of memories at which you can laugh, cry or get embarrassed in retrospect, it is more about you as a person than about your armor of possession you have to shield you from your true self. Life is way too short for waiting for the next big thing to happen - create it yourself. Go out there and do some main character shit.
