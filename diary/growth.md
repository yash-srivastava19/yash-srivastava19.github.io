### Growth is the Only Constant of Life

Stay with me on this one. Life is not the same for everyone, and that's a very good thing. We all come from different backgrounds and we try to optimize for things which we feel are important for us during that stage of life. 

Growth is an opportunity, and is probably the only constant of life.

From the limited experience I've had so far, growth is probably the only thing that has been there everytime. You might not see it or seek it, but it is always there. You can't go through life without growth in any dimension. Wins give you growth, and so does failure. Although it is quite nice that there are fruits of growth ready to be plucked by us, in my case, I happen to do something strange.

I noticed a pattern I've been doing for a while and it was alarming, which goes something like - even though I dream big and have huge ambitions, I sometimes deliberately opt myself out of opportunities of growth due to fear of failure. Now I don't completely blame myself for that, because I've had my fair share of bad experiences, but sometimes I think I give up in the starting itself because I worry more about what's going to happen 10 miles down the road rather than focusing on taking actionable steps in the present. I have severe anxiety when it comes to this, because I can't deal with so many unknowns. I shy away from showing my vulnerability because I'm just scared. Scaring then feeds into the anxiety and the cycle continues.

Going into 2025, I'll be adopting practices to not pursue this area. I'll be more open to new avenues of failure, but will maintain a strong sense of being and navigate through life without fear. It is going to take some time, and I'll be doing my best to live a more fulfilling, eventful, and purpose driven life. If you are in the same boat, you can always message me, and we can talk more about it. Hoping this new year gives us the strength to deal with life - one problem at a time.
