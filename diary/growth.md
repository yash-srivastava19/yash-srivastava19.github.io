### Growth is the Only Constant of Life

Stay with me on this one. Life is not the same for everyone, and that's a very good thing. We all come from different backgrounds and we try to optimize for things which we feel are important for us during that stage of life. 

Growth is an opportunity, and is probably the only constant of life.

From the limited experience I've had so far, growth is probably the only thing that has been there everytime. You might not see it or seek it, but it is always there. You can't go through life without growth in any dimension. Wins give you growth, and so does failure. Although it is quite nice that there are fruits of growth ready to be plucked by us, in my case, I happen to do something strange.

I noticed a pattern I've been doing for a while and it was alarming, which goes something like - even though I dream big and have huge ambitions, I sometimes deliberately opt myself out of opportunities of growth due to fear of failure. Now I don't completely blame myself for that, because I've had my fair share of bad experiences, but sometimes I think I give up in the starting itself because I worry more about what's going to happen 10 miles down the road rather than focusing on taking actionable steps in the present. I have severe anxiety when it comes to this, because I can't deal with so many unknowns. I shy away from showing my vulnerability because I'm just scared. Scaring then feeds into the anxiety and the cycle continues.

Going into 2025, I'll be adopting practices to not pursue this area. I'll be more open to new avenues of failure, but will maintain a strong sense of being and navigate through life without fear. It is going to take some time, and I'll be doing my best to live a more fulfilling, eventful, and purpose driven life. If you are in the same boat, you can always message me, and we can talk more about it. Hoping this new year gives us the strength to deal with life - one problem at a time.

### Love on the Cusp of Goodbyes [Date - 09-11-2024]

There's something about goodbyes that just makes me feel hollow. Growing up, I never knew how to express (or receive) love, so I always had a bitter sweet relationship with it. Love is a little more complicated than that in the sense that you are always surrounded by it, more so when you think you don't deserve any of it.

Being the kind of person I am, it took me forever to realise just how much I was surrounded by love, I just never had the ability to see it. There's a small catch to this - it all seems to go well till it's time to say goodbye.

There's something beautiful about unexpressed love that makes you overcompensate for love you didn't act on before. There's guilt, there's closure and there's hope that things are the same, even though you promise you'll be better at expressing it moving forward. Each glance on your loved one invokes an emotion you never had before.

Unexpressed love comes in all shapes and sizes. You can see it in your parents when they're packing more "food" just so you never feel homesick. It is in that extra "long" hug at airports and stations, and in that "one last walk" at farewell parties. Nothing can ever prepare you for this hollow feeling, and no amount of "last minute" love can make up for it.

That's beautiful in its own way. The guilt, or the grief means that there's always going to be a part of them in you.  It's just so beautiful how emotions work. The only way you make sure someone's memory always stays with you is to have some pain attached to it.
