### Destiny or Luck?
I don't like to think that everything in life is predetermined, but I do believe in destiny. I've been the fortunate one in many of my relationships, achievements which I believe is because of destiny, not luck. There is a huge difference between them, and let me try to explain it. Destiny is not just the outcome, but an amalgam of the process, people and destination.

I read somewhere that we keep changing every three years or so. Our goals change, our priorities change, and our relationships change. Life would've been much easier(but a lot boring) if we just knew what we wanted to do, and we spent our entire lives dedicated to it. Fortunately, that is not the case. Destiny is not just getting to an end point, it is the deliberate practice of believing in yourself throughout the journey, and allowing yourself to grow along the process. The reality is, we either never allow ourselves to grow, or our destiny was never ours in the first place.

Most of the things I'm proud of in life were never handed to me, but was a result of a lot of hard-work which fueled my destiny. I don't like to live my life by following a path, and try to be open on what life has to offer me? Does that mean I don't put in the efforts? No, I absolutely do. Do I believe in destiny? Yes, by creating opportunities for luck so that life can embrace me with it.  That's why I don't actively believe in the practice of blind manifestation. I don't do is try to force something which isn't there. I work for it, and if I don't "get" it, maybe it wasn't meant to be. If it is bound to me, I believe destiny is there to make me cross paths with it again.

Things will come to you if you create opportunities for them to thrive. Bon Voyage!!
