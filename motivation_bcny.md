# Notes on Roadtrips

Finding a career is a really tough choice. There are an overwhelming number of choices for an overwhelming number of trajectories. I’ve spent a huge amount of mental power to find what I want from a career, and how to manage it in a sustained way. I’ve been both rejected(a lot) and selected(few times) in many of my career pursuits due to the fact that I’m very particular when it comes to values that I both preach and follow. Now I am a firm believer that when you put something in writing, you start to understand it better, but I don’t know exactly how to say it properly, so I’ll stick to talking about something completely else - let's talk about [road trips](https://thebrowser.company/values/#top).

I’ve been on a lot of road trips in India, and it was not until I was 18 that I had my first flight experience, (and believe it or not, I still am a little scared of them) and it felt a little too chaotic to me. Road trips have been much calmer, and felt a lot more natural. Not all trips I had were the best, but they have left a fingerprint on me and instead of talking about why am I a good candidate for BCNY, I’m going to talk about road trips(1 real, and 2 virtual).

### A trip of realizations:
1. I grew up in a family where there was a lot of unexpressed love. We did a lot to love each other, but we never said it to them directly. Classic asian household story. One of my most recent road trips was when I traveled from Varanasi to my home(about 16 hours!) just because I wanted to break this tradition of unvoiced love I had for my family.

2. This was back in summer 2023, when I got an internship offer in my sophomore year of college in Indian Institute of Technology -Banaras Hindu University to work on something I loved, and because of the schedule that I had that semester, I was not able to go home for about 6 months for the first time in my life.

3. Surviving in a new city where you know nobody while you are away from your family is really hard, and on top of that staying on top of your work is a big challenge. Most of the time during my tenure there, I was confused, irritated and felt like everything was crashing at the same time. 

3. Being someone who was raised in an asian household, I was not able to exactly pinpoint why am I feeling so confused and out of place, and finally after a lot of visits to the Ghats and Temples of Varanasi, I figured I had built up a lot of unexpressed love which was just at the brim of my heart.

4. My family has made a lot of sacrifices for me to be where I am in my career. My mother gave up her job as a teacher and my father stayed away from us so that I can have a better education. I realized this really early in life, so I almost never demanded anything from them. I mean what more can I ask for? But I’ve had enough of wasting love by keeping it away from the people I love that most. I needed to do something. 

5. Initially, my plan was to not go to home entirely, and go into the next semester directly from there, but I guess I can still plan a surprise visit(for many of those of you who are reading this, this might sound silly, but this was very new to me) So, I made a plan to go to my home after asking my supervisor whether it was okay to leave a little early(crazy how sometimes you just have to ask, and things work for you)

6. This road trip was the most fulfilling of my life so far. I was so eager to just meet them and see their reactions. I barely slept on the journey, just thinking of all the childhood memories and how grateful I am to have my family by my side. It is true that Varanasi really does change you. 

7. So, in the most Bollywood actor style energy I could match, I simply rang my doorbell and to my surprise, everyone in my family was so happy to see me(in the asian way, of course). Although my mother was a little angry because I didn’t pick up her call in the night(cause that would jeopardize the surprise), but I guess I was able to make the amends for it. 

8. This road trip made me realize just how important it is for me to make people close to me feel better. I guess it is our duty to make people close to us feel appreciated. Madela was right when he said “What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.” I have lived a huge chunk of my life optimizing my situations and my problems, but rarely I looked at the bigger picture. Life’s too short to not spend it with people you love, and even shorter to not tell them how you feel, so going forward, it is now my priority to make people feel good, and that just makes me realize how lucky I have been in my life.

If it were a normal pitch, I would go all in with my achievements, but my ambition is not to just work, but rather work on something that gives me purpose, something for which I can take ownership, something which allows other people to grow, something where I can creatively contribute to the best of my abilities - and something that liberates(otherwise, what is the purpose?). Vinod Khosla was right when he said, “the team you build is the company you build”, and I want to try my best to make you believe I’m capable enough to be on the team.

### A trip of roadblocks:
1. This trip is very close to my heart, because it is not exactly a road trip, but a phase in my life where there were a lot of roadblocks, and how did I realized my passion.

2. Creativity has been a strong motivator for me since I was a child, although in an unconventional way. I was never the smartest kid, never the most outgoing kind, did not really have many friends but I found my love in computers. I used to play and build a lot of computer games, and to this day, that is one of the most cherished memories I have of my childhood. 
 
3. As I grew older, my love matured, it was not all about games, I fell in love with mathematics and science and went ahead with studying engineering as I found the best alignment with my interests, but the place where I come from, it is not so easy to achieve your dreams, cause of the sheer number of people we have. We are hard-working, talented people, but somtimes we have to sacrifice in order to survive. We realise very later in life what matters to us.

4. Love is a really strong motivator for me, so I went ahead with engineering, but the more I studied this field, the more I realized that following MY dream was more than about me. I know, it sounds a bit confusing, but let me explain in a way that makes sense.

5. Passions are more self-centered, and there are very few lucky people who get to make their passion into their career, and those people who do that, have been the most influential people throughout the course of history. Passion is not the destination, but rather a fuel. As I grew older, I realized my definition of success hinges a lot on how I can add value to other people, and I realized that what I was calling “love”, was actually “responsibility”. 

6. Since that realization, I take roadblocks and challenges in a different sense. When you are working on the greater good for the community, action precedes motivation. Success is not mostly about you, it is about how much easier you make other people’s life while doing what you love, and that for me is the ultimate goal of my life. This is my “[heartfelt intensity](https://thebrowser.company/values/#1)” that gives me enjoyment to work on hard problems.
  
7. Working at a place like BCNY, I can contribute creatively, work for the benefit of people, and obsess over the little details for the shared love of the product. 

Life is not easy, and especially not easy when you don’t give yourself an opportunity to make it easy. You can be the smartest and most talented person in the world, but if you stay in the cages of your comfort zone, you’ll never grow. 

### A trip outside of my comfort zone:
1. Another trip that is really close to my heart is the one I took 3 years back when I started to live outside my comfort zone. 

2. A life without challenges is a life without desires. Life almost never follows a pre-decided script, and however obsessed you are with controlling the parameters of your life, you can’t account for everything. Challenges are what make life interesting, and overcoming them is what gives life meaning. 

3. When I turned 18, I was not really at the best point in my life. I was not happy, felt like everything was a huge burden and didn’t have the best of the situations due to several other factors. I was burned out a lot, and never felt like doing anything. It was a really bad phase in my life, but that’s the thing about phases, they are not permanent.  
 
4. We have to realize that in life, nothing is an overnight process, things take time. We will grow only when we give ourselves an opportunity to grow, but the hard pill to swallow is that it will never be in your comfort zone. Life will always give you opportunities to get outside of your comfort zone, and once you get used to the feeling, things become a lot easier. For me, all it takes is just 20 seconds of courage to say YES, and I can get outside my comfort zone, and with the necessary tools, create opportunities into achievements. 

5. Since that phase in my life, I have been able to achieve a lot. I’ve overcome my fear of a) stage fright, b) my fear of failure and c) my fear of judgment. 18 year old me would have never imagined that in such a small span of time. I have learned a lot in any domain I want to study in, I took on challenges bigger than myself which made me a better problem solver, and doing what I loved with ownership to give back to people gave me a purpose.


First of all, congratulations for making it to this part of the “notes about road trips”. It gets a little overwhelming to talk about values, so going forward with road trips was the best thing. I would be really stoked to work at BCNY as an intern, and would love to hop on chat/call to discuss more. I’m open to relocation/remote/anything, and I just want to work on a product I love and use. You can find more about my work [here](https://www.yash-sri.xyz/). Let’s hope my message reaches you !!

Best Regards,
Yash.
