## About Me üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: 
I am Yashovardhan Srivastava(quite a mouthful, so Yash is good) a passed out undergraduate engineering student from National Institute of Technology, Warangal(2025). From a young age, I have been fascinated by computers. As I grew older, this fascination turned into crush and crush turned into love - and from that moment, I haven't looked back. I am obsessed with programming. My obsesison has made me someone who likes to build a lot - and that has had a huge ROI for me. I believe I am capable enough to produce some original work, I try to do so from time to time, producing projects that help me deepen my understanding of something I'm interested in. That, for me is the definition of luxury - working on things you like.

All of projects are a result of extreme dedication, meticulousness, and hardwork. Most of them are just random thoughts that I once had, and I thought echoing in my brain that - **I can build that**. The journey from there to actually making something worth checking out has made me a somewhat decent programmer.

## Career Goals ü•Ö: 
I try to practice the luxury I talked about - I want to study things that fascinate me, and build things that make me happy.

The place where I come from, this is NOT a trend. We are hard-working, talented people-but we realise very later in life what matters to us. True satisfaction comes from happiness-and that is the purpose of life.

Anyone who has studied Engineering(especially in India) will tell how "academically challenging" and "rigorous" the degree is - an I believe it is somewhat justified. Engineers are responsible for building the "lego blocks" on which society stands, and when you work for the greater good of society, you better be the best. I always say, *Engineering is a great profession in theory, but(especially here, in India), really bad in practice*. I guess my love for engineering did not fade away even after going through this system, so doing this art of "scale up" is something I can see myself working in.

This is the reason why I'm a researcher in free time, and an engineer full time. That is, I come up with new ideas, and try testing them at various scales.

## What do I look for in a workplace?
I've been workin in startups from some time, and after giving countless interviews and havin chats with founders, here's my few requirements that I look for in a workplace:

- **Innovation over bureaucracy:** In most organization, great ideas get tossed into the bin due to bureaucracy. I feel in a good org, ideas flow freely, and innovation is valued more highly - regardless of your position.
  
- **Mission over projects:** An org with a clear mission works in a calculated fashion than an org that hops from project to project. Engineers thrive in environments where there contributions serve a greater mission.
  
- **Teamwork over individuality:** A talented team from which I can learn is the best, and is something I look for positively. I am by no means expert, and with a talented team I try to learn how to effectively communicate, solve problems and basically manage tasks that are given to me.

Other than that, basic requirements such as good and timely pay, flexibility in working hours, and a sense of respect from the organization would be ideal.

## Proficiency and Interests ‚≠ê :
- Research Interests : Natural Language Processing, AI.
- Languages : Programming(C, C++,Python, R, Julia)
- Frameworks: Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras(and anything if given enough time)

## Achievements ü•á
#### Honours
- Promoted as the President of Big Data Analytics and Consulting Cell(National Institute of Technology, Warangal) for the year 2024-2025.
- Received Kaggle Notebook and Dataset Expert with an overall rank of 699 and 573 respectively.
  
- Personal Interests : Football, badminton, avid reader, philosophy connoisseur and writing. 

## Research Papers I Love üìé
In no particular order, I am listing some really awesome research papers that in one way or other have helped me think outside of the box.

 - **[Interpretability in the Wild - IOI Circuit Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00593)** : A very detailed and understandable paper on circuit identification for mechanistic interpretability. Highly recommended if you want to understand how to design your own experiments.

  - **[The Hardware Lottery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06489.pdf)** : Probably one of my favorite papers till day. The way Sara Hookor explained how AI/ML research should proceed, and how is it going till now is a real eye opener. Highly highly recommend if you want to look at the bigger picture of AI research. 
  
  - **[Scaling Scaling Laws For Board Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03113)** : Andy Jones is a genius. This paper explained how we can use shorter experiments to predict outcomes of larger experiments - which are resource heavy. Highly recommend if you want learn how scale up works in real life. 

  - **[Building Machines that Learn and Think for Themselves - Commentary on Lake, Ullman, Tenenbaum, and Gershman](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00289.pdf)** : Not exactly a paper, but this really forced me to think about some things. Definitely recommend this for casual reading.   
      
  - **[A Two-Systems Perspective for Computational Thinking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03201.pdf)** : This is one of the first papers that I read and it blew my mind. Inspired by the Kahneman's Two Systems Approach of Thinking(Thinking Fast and Slow), this papers presents the cognitive models against which computational thinking can be analyzed and evaluated.

  - **[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)** : It's everyone's favourite research paper-and mine too. This was the paper that introduced transformers, and the rest is history. This paper taught me how to communicate your research and how to present your work.
 
  - **[Recsim-A configurable platform for recommender systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04847.pdf)** : This opened my eyes. I was in awe when I found out we can use reinforcement learning in recommendation setting. I even emailed the author of the paper thanking and asking him what he thinks whether this will be used in future recommendation systems. Google Research for the WIN.
    
  - **[Improving Low-Resource NMT through Relevance Based Linguistic Features Incorporation](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.376.pdf)**: This was a really well written and structured paper, which I was able to understand easily, and even used for testing in my internship project.
