## Hello Everyone !! 
Hi ! This is your friendly neighborhood Yash Srivastava. This is the homepage of my GitHub Pages website. This page will serve as a navigator for some of my most loved and cherished projects. While the good stuff is about to come, I hope what I love doing doesn't get unnoticed. 


## About Me: 
Well, where to start ? I am Yashovardhan Srivastava(quite a mouthful - Yash is good) an undergraduate engineering student in National Institute of Technology, Warangal(Department of Chemical Engineering). From a young age, I have been fascinated by computers. As I grew older, this fascination turned into crush and crush turned into love - and from that moment, I haven't looked back. I believe opensource projects has played a significant role in that. They made me fall in love with research, development and much more. Since now I believe I am capable enough to produce some original work, I want to be a part of this beautiful journey, in which all of you play an important role,

All of projects are a result of extreme dedication, meticulousness, and hardwork. Most of them are just random thoughts that I once thought - What If ?
They do not need recognition, they need discussions. I might have reached a dead end with some of those - but their cycle isn't complete. I have plenty of projects in pipeline, which I hope will be just beautiful as the ones which are already there.
