## Hello Everyone !! 
Hi ! This is your friendly neighborhood Yash Srivastava. This is the homepage of my GitHub Pages website. This page will serve as a navigator for some of my most loved and cherished projects. While the good stuff is about to come, I hope what I love doing doesn't get unnoticed. 


## About Me: 
Well, where to start ? I am Yashovardhan Srivastava(quite a mouthful - Yash is good) an undergraduate engineering student in National Institute of Technology, Warangal(Department of Chemical Engineering). From a young age, I have been fascinated by computers. As I grew older, this fascination turned into crush and crush turned into love - and from that moment, I haven't looked back. I believe opensource projects has played a significant role in that. They made me fall in love with research, development and much more. Since now I believe I am capable enough to produce some original work, I want to be a part of this beautiful journey, in which all of you play an important role,

All of projects are a result of extreme dedication, meticulousness, and hardwork. Most of them are just random thoughts that I once thought-What If ?
They do not need recognition, they need discussions. I might have reached a dead end with some of those - but their cycle isn't complete. I have plenty of projects in pipeline, which I hope will be just beautiful as the ones which are already there.


## Proficiency and Interests :
- Research Interests : Quantum Machine Learning, Medical Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning.

- Learning : QML(Qiskit, TFQ), Deep Reinforcement Learning(ChainerRL, Dopamine, Mesa), Reinforcement Learning(Gym,Torch,TFlow, RecSim),MLOps(TFX), Research(Recommender Systems, Medical Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, ACO ), Miscellaneous(Edward2, Story Writing, Philosophy)

- Languages Familiarity :  Spoken(Hindi, English, Very Basic Spanish), Programming(C, C++, *C#, Python, R, Julia)

## Career Goals : 
Wooh. That's a tough one. There are many things that I like and I feel it is difficult to commit to something. But, there comes a time when we need commit to a field. Balance between exploration and exploitation needs to be made-and for me, that comes from working on research problems. I want to study more, to do things that make me happy.

The place where I come from, this is NOT a trend. We are hard-working, talented people-but we realise very later in life what matters to us. True satisfaction comes from happiness-and that is the purpose of life. I choose to take the road not taken.

I see myself as a research scientist in the near future-specifically in the field of AI with domain knowledge of business applications(another one my interest). In short - I want to be mixture of Sam Altman and Stuart Russel ðŸ˜º    

## Reseach Papers I Love
In no particular order, I am listing doen some really awesome reserach papers that in one way or other have helped me think outside of the box.
  - A Two-Systems Perspective for Computational Thinking : This is one of the first papers that I read and it blew my mind. Inspired by the Kahneman's Two Systems Approach of Thinking(Thinking Fast and Slow), this papers presents the cognitive models against which computational thinking can be analyzed and evaluated.
  - Attention is all you need : It's everyone's favourite research paper-and mine too. This was the paper that introduced transformers, and the rest is history. This paper taught me how to communicate your research and how to present your work.
  - Recsim-A configurable platform for recommender systems : This opened my eyes. I was in awe when I found out we can use reinforcement learning in recommendation setting. I even emailed the author of the paper thanking and asking him what he thinks whether this will be used in future recommendation systems. Google Research for the WIN.
